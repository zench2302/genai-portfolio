# üß† Jia Jia ‚Äì GenAI/ML Project Portfolio

Welcome! This is a collection of my recent projects in Generative AI, built during my MSc Data Science at LSE and reflecting my transition into AI product development. My focus has been on LLM-based recommendation systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and prompt engineering with open-source tools.

## üìå 1. [LLM-Based Product Recommender](https://github.com/zench2302/llm-recommender)

### Description: 

Developed an end-to-end recommendation system powered by LLMs for Amazon product reviews. The system embeds product metadata and review content using Flan-T5 and MiniLM, then computes similarity via Faiss for Top-5 recommendations.

### Key Technologies:  
- Nous-Hermes-2 (Mistral) for generating user profiles from review history
- Flan-T5 for generating ad-style recommendation reasons  
- BGE (BAAI) and MiniLM embeddings for product and user vectorization  
- FAISS for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) vector search and candidate retrieval  
- Prompt engineering for review summarization and recommendation reasoning

# Creative Tech
### 1. üéß Live Coding with Strudel: Exploring Code-Based Music Interaction
London Data Week 2025 ‚Äì Algorave Workshop @ King‚Äôs Institute for AI

In this hands-on workshop, I explored the intersection of code, rhythm, and creative expression using Strudel ‚Äî a browser-based live coding tool for generative music. Participants learned to construct musical patterns through time-based code snippets and were invited to perform their compositions in an open stage format.

While I didn‚Äôt create a full performance piece, I gained direct experience in:

- Writing loop-based musical patterns using declarative syntax

- Understanding how code structure translates to rhythm and timing

- Experiencing the dynamics of collaborative, real-time generative systems

The session also prompted reflection on the human-computer interaction aspect of creative coding: how intuitive (or not) such tools are for newcomers, and how live-coded performances affect audience perception. This exploration connects back to my broader interest in generative AI and interactive systems design, where usability, expressiveness, and emotional impact must be balanced.
